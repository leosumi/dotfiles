# This is my world

Everything important is here. Notably the config files for :

* vim
* tmux
* bash

## Install

1. git clone https://github.com/leosumi/dotfiles .dotfiles
2. ./install.sh

Remember to modify the scripts if the dotfiles folder path is changed.

## Contents

Besides the config files there is some scripts for in the install folder. They
will work on Debian based distros.
* locale.sh to change the locale
* packages.sh to install some packages listed in packages.list
* links.sh to put the config files in the right places
* pluginsInstall.sh to get tpm, vundle, etc

## I always forget

* To run tpm in tmux
* To run vundle in vim
* To install brave, rstudio and slack
